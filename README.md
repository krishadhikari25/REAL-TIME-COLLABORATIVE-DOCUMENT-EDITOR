# REAL-TIME-COLLABORATIVE-DOCUMENT-EDITOR
real-time collaborative document editor using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and Node.js as the backend framework.
Using WebSocket communication, I have implemented real-time updates so any changes made by one user are immediately reflected for all other participants in the same room. Routes are handled in the backend using Node.js and Express.js, with API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing collaborative sessions
